.net is a framework for building applications on windows

.net consists of - CLR (common language runtime) and a class library

C/C++ came before c#

c# compiles into an intermediate language that is dependent on the computer it is running on
CLR is an application which translates the IL code to machine code (Just in time)




.net Architecture -- 

Applications consist of building blocks called classes
classes collaborate at runtime and provide functionality
class - container that has data(attributes) and (functions)methods

as a # of classes increases we need to organize the classes
namespace - container for related classes

ex: working with data, working with graphics/images, working with security


assembly - container for related namespaces (DLL - dynamically linked library)
Compilers build one or more assemblies depending on how you partition your code
