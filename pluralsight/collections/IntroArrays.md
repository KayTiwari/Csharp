Collection -- a collection is a type whose purpose is to group data together
-many objects at the same time
-let you treat lots of objects as one single object

General 3 collections - array, list, dictionary


//Arrays
Array characteristics
fixed size in and items are ordered in a definite way

Instantiated:
string[] identifier = {
    "1",
    "2",
    "3"
};

foreach loops for iteration - O(n)




Basic terms:
Element/Item - an object in a collection
Enumerating/Iterate? - going through each item in a collection, one by one.
Look up an item - access an individual item in a collection


Why use Zero-based indexing?
Made memory management easier
Better for performance
