Encapsulation - Allows us to hide details about our code

Inheritance - Gives  us the ability to reuse code over similar classes

Polymorphism - Objects of the same type can behave differently
one book object stores grades in memory, while another stores grades in a file

Encapsulation is the most important pillar, and the key to good software design



//Inheritance
base classes
derived classes contain methods contained in the base class
