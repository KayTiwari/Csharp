Interfaces help us maintain, extend, and test.

Interfaces are contracts when a class inherits it must fulfill.
Contracts may include properties, methods, events, and indexers.

Concrete class - regular class, does not need implementation of virtual members

Abstract class - all abstract members must be implements

Interface - needs all members provided
