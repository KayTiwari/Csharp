Branching w/ If Statements--

Programs are read from top to down

If statements are used to branch the flow into various directions depending on the conditions given

Works the same way as JS just without strict ===




Looping Constructs--

foreach (var iterator in array or object){
    statement
}


var index = 0
do
{
    statement 
    ex: Math.Min(array[index], result.Low);
}
while (condition)


for - same as JS and Go




break keyword - stops loops early

goto keyword: put into code block after setting up a label 
ex:

if(condition){
    goto done;
}

done: do this
