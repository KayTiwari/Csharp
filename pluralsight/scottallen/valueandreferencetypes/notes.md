reference types - classes

value types - integers, floats, strings, doubles

var b = new Book("grades"); -> reference
var x = 3; -> value type

reference types point to areas in the memory

solution file - file that keeps track of multiple projects

ref/out keywords allow you to pass strictly by reference


class - classes define ref types. Any variable defined as a class point to an object in memory
struct - special type that behaves like a value type, very small amount of memory, much more efficient than ref types. Writing a struct is similar to class in fields and methods. 
All primitive data types are structs
